irsel: Information Retrieval axiom SELection
============================================

To set up on a Linux system with Python 3, install some additional dependencies:
python3 -m pip install gavel

Then run as follows:
./irsel.sh <tptp problem file>

On a Windows machine, install WSL-Ubuntu, install the dependencies in wsl.exe and run in cmd.exe:
irsel <tptp problem file>

(Possibly edit ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gavel/dialects/tptp/compiler.py according to https://github.com/MGlauer/python-gavel/pull/1.)
